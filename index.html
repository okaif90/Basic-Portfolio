		<p class="main-text">I was born in Columbus, Ohio and lived there for several  years while my father obtained his Masters in Mathematics and taught at THE Ohio State University. At the age of seven my family and I packed our bags and moved to Scottsdale, Arizona where I have lived for over the past 20 years. Upon completing high school I attended THE University of Arionza, where I obtained my Bachelors in Economics and Minor in Management.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="main-text">After working at JPMorgan Chase for two years I decided to pursue my MBA at the Thunderbird School of Global Management. It was during my Masters program where I recognized the need for techinically savy IT leaders in an ever growing industry. After completing a Project Management internship with a local company, SkyTouch Technology, I joined Syntel, a global IT Services Provider which primarily services one key client in the Phoenix Area- American Express.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="main-text">It has been two years since i've joined Syntel, and while i've had the privelege of acting as a Project Manager and Test Leader, I know that I still have a long ways to go to be the techincally savy IT leader I dreamed of being in graduate school. My hope is that through the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, I can add to my existing knowledge base and progress forward towards my overall goal.</p>
